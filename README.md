**How to use**: once you download the required code in a java ide, run the code. You will be shown a simple user interface showing you a list of categories to choose from. choosing one directs you to its sub categories to choose from. Choosing one of those sub categories will then lead you to input a number of companies to look at from greatest exchange rate to least exchange rate.
